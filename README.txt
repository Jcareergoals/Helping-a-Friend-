Helping a dear friend of mines

My friend currently in college pursuing a Degree in Information Technology (IT) needed assistance with an array assignment. He was having issues understanding the logic for the assignment. Although, he originally attempted to complete the assignment in C, I completed the assignment by creating a single page web application using JQuery. By using another language, I was able to help him while also not the full answers and I also challenged him to complete it in the C language he was originally attempting to use.
